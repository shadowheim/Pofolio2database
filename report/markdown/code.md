# The Code

The Java program has been made in such a way that the program asks the user what they want to know. The user is then able input a certain value that the program asked for.

Due to time constraints, we’ve opted not to make a class for SQLite interactions, but under other circumstances we would have done so. Furthermore, even though we opted for a mostly monolithic structure, it’s still scalable in terms of students can easily be assigned more courses in the database, and the code would still without fault trivers through all ungraded courses.
